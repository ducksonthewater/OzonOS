01: Installation and Configuration

Before starting development, we have to install the needed software. I am using a Mac, but on other systems, you can create the OS as well.

First of all, we need a few things:

1. I have installed brew on mac Mac, which can install a lot of open source software by fetching the source code, compiling and installing it. You can get it via a simple Terminal command.
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2. Next install NASM, the Netwide Assembler. IT will output a flat binary, which we can throw at the virtual machine. In Terminal, just type:

brew install nasm

If it was correctly installed, you can run it by calling in Terminal:

nasm

It should give you an error message like "nasm: fatal: no input file specified"


3. Now, you install a virtual machine, something, that will simulate a PC with a clear set of possible functions. Our PC needs a PS/2-Mouse, a 80286, a VGA, Soundblaster or Gravis Ultrasound and a network card, like the NE2000. My choice is QEMU, but you can also go for BOCHS. In Terminal type:

brew install qemu

We will only need the x86/x64-thing, which will be qemu-system-x86_64. You should test it, by running the virtual machine in Terminal.

qemu-system-x86_64

If you clicked the Terminal-window, and the mouse is gone, just press Control-Option-G to release the mouse. QEMU will show CTRL-ALT-G in the window-header as well.

4. And finally, install a decent text-editor with offers syntax highlighting for the 8086-Assembler language. My weapon of choice is BBEdit, but you can also use Atom or even MS Visual Studio Code. For BBEdit, you have to download the NASM-highlighting from the link below, and copy the plist to ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules

5. For reading the binary output, I use the excellent 0xed.

6. There is no step 6.
